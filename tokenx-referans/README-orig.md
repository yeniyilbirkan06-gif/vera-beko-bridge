- **FiscalInfo.cs**: Defines structures for fiscal data from POS devices (PLUs, sections, etc.).
- **ReceiptInfo.cs**: Models for receipt data returned after payment transactions.

### Integration Approach

- Uses a callback-based approach for asynchronous communication with POS devices
- Serializes/deserializes data using JSON for cross-platform compatibility
