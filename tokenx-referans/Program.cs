/**
 * TokenDotNet - Point of Sale (POS) Integration Client
 * =================================================================
 * 
 * Language/Platform: C# Windows Forms Application (.NET Framework)
 * 
 * Project Description:
 * This application serves as a client implementation for integrating with POS 
 * (Point of Sale) devices through the "TokenX Connect (Wired)" or "Integration Hub" 
 * service. It establishes communication between merchant systems and payment terminals.
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * - Implements TOKEN FINTECH integration protocols
 * - Uses IntegrationHub library for POS communication
 * - Provides a Windows Forms based user interface (MainForm) for interaction
 * 
 * Integration Details:
 * This client establishes a communication channel with POS devices through the 
 * IntegrationHub.POSCommunication singleton instance. The application identifies
 * itself as "TOKEN FINTECH" to the integration service, which enables proper 
 * routing and protocol handling for payment transactions.
 * 
 * Version Information:
 * Current version: 2.1.0
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This application initializes the Windows Forms environment and launches the main
 * interface (MainForm) which handles user interactions and payment operations.
